# rich-text-types

Type Definition and constants for Contentful Rich Text.

Block constants partially taken from [markup-it](https://github.com/GitbookIO/markup-it).

## Releases flow

We follow [angular commit format](https://gist.github.com/stephenparish/9941e89d80e2bc58a153#allowed-type) to generate a changelog.

You'll need to use `npm run commit`, to create conventional commits.
