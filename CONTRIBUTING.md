We appreciate any community contributions to this project, whether in the form
of issues or pull requests.

This document outlines what we'd like you to follow in terms of commit messages
and code style.

It also explains what to do if you want to set up the project locally and run
tests.

## Useful npm scripts

- `yarn build` builds vendored files in the `dist` directory of each package
- `yarn commit` runs git commits with [commitizen](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/)
- `yarn clean` removes any built files and `node_modules`
- `yarn lint` runs our TypeScript linter on all `.ts` files in each package
- `yarn test` runs unit tests for all packages
- `yarn test:watch` runs unit tests in "watch" mode (will refresh relevant
  code paths on save)

## Setup

This project is a [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/) monorepo with several packages,
each published separately to npm.

### Local Development

Run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.

As a post-install step, all Lerna dependencies are [hoisted](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/blob/master/doc/hoist.md),
and hence internally reliant packages (e.g., `rich-text-html-renderer`, which
depends upon `rich-text-types`) will resolve their modules via symlink. In other
words, `npm install` will _both_ install external dependencies for each project,
_and_ ensure packages that pull in other packages in this repository as
dependencies are linked to the local version (rather than whatever the state
of those packages is on npm).

Each package is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and
compiled to ES5 using [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en) to the `dist`
directory.

This should generally only happen at publishing time, but you may want to run
`yarn build` prematurely during local development.

For example, let's say you're working on a pull request that

1. adds support for a type in `rich-text-types`, and
2. adds behavior to handle that type in `rich-text-html-renderer`.

If changes in the latter are dependent upon changes in the former, you'll need
to run `yarn build` to update the referenced vendored files in
`rich-text-html-renderer`.

All necessary dependencies are installed under `node_modules` and any necessary
tools can be accessed via npm scripts. There is no need to install anything
globally.

### Creating commits

We follow [Angular JS Commit Message Conventions](https://gist.github.com/stephenparish/9941e89d80e2bc58a153#allowed-type)
to generate a changelog, enforced by [commitizen](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/).
You'll need to use `yarn commit` to create conventional commits.

### Code style

This project uses [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/) and
[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) conventions. Install a relevant editor plugin
if you'd like. When in doubt, follow a style similar to the existing code :)

We use a common [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en) config to compile
packages from TypeScript to ES5. We also use common [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
and [tslint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) configs. You'll notice
the `rollup.config.js` and `tsconfig.json` in each package largely reference
those files on a root level - this keeps code conventions consistent across the
repository as a whole.

### Running tests

We use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit tests. See **Useful npm scripts**
above for some relevant npm commands.

### Benchmarks

Some packages may contain benchmark scripts to prevent against performance
regressions. We use [Benchmark](https://benchmarkjs.com/) for these. Benchmarked
files should be written in TypeScript with the same code style and formatting
conventions as the rest of the codebase - we use `ts-node` (anchored to the
Node version in `./node-version`) to evaluate these.

Benchmarks are stored in the `bin/benchmark` folder of each relevant package.
To run all benchmarks for a particular package, e.g. `rich-text-links`, you
can run the npm `benchmark` script scoped to that package:

```sh
yarn benchmark @contentful/rich-text-links
```

or

```sh
yarn benchmark rich-text-links
```

Before submitting a pull request for a package with benchmarked code paths,
please make sure that your changes do not negatively impact performance.
(Of course, PRs _improving_ performance are always welcome! :smile:)

## Publishing

We use [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) to:

- keep dependencies in sync
  - `lerna bootstrap --hoist` (which is run as a post-install step)
- publish
  - `NPM_CONFIG_OTP={2fa_otp_goes_here} yarn publish`
  - As a community developer, you most likely won't have to worry about this
    step :)
